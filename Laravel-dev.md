To set up a Laravel project for development, follow these steps:

1. Install Composer Dependencies:
   Run the following command to install the required PHP dependencies using Composer:
   ```
   composer install
   ```

2. Install NPM Dependencies:
   Next, install the JavaScript dependencies using npm (Node Package Manager):
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Build Front-end Assets:
   If your project includes front-end assets such as JavaScript and CSS, you need to compile them. Use the following command:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```
   This command will compile your assets for development purposes. If you are working in a production environment, you can use `npm run prod` instead.

4. Create Environment File:
   Laravel uses an environment file to store configuration variables. Copy the example environment file to create your own:
   ```
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

5. Generate Application Key:
   Laravel requires an application key to securely encrypt user sessions and other sensitive data. Generate the key with the following command:
   ```
   php artisan key:generate
   ```

6. Run Migrations:
   If your project uses a database, run the migrations to create the necessary tables:
   ```
   php artisan migrate
   ```

7. Seed the Database (Optional):
   If you have database seeders defined to populate your database with sample data, you can run them with the following command:
   ```
   php artisan db:seed
   ```

With these steps, your Laravel project should be set up and ready for development.

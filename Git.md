To install Git on an Ubuntu server in the cloud, you can follow these steps:

1. Update Package Lists:
   Connect to your Ubuntu server via SSH and update the package lists to ensure you have the latest information about available packages. Run the following command:
   ```
   sudo apt update
   ```

2. Install Git:
   Run the following command to install Git on your server:
   ```
   sudo apt install git
   ```

   This command will download and install Git from the Ubuntu package repository.

3. Verify the Installation:
   After the installation is complete, you can verify that Git is installed correctly by checking its version. Run the following command:
   ```
   git --version
   ```

   If Git is installed successfully, you will see the Git version information.

4. Configure Git (Optional):
   If you haven't configured Git with your username and email address, you can set them up using the following commands:
   ```
   git config --global user.name "Your Name"
   git config --global user.email "yourname@example.com"
   ```

   Replace "Your Name" with your preferred Git username and "yourname@example.com" with your email address.

With these steps, you should have Git successfully installed on your Ubuntu server in the cloud. You can now use Git for version control and collaboration on your projects.
